# Noteful Server

This is the Node server for my Noteful full stack application. 

It uses knex and postgrator migrations to interact with a PostgreSQL database.

It serves data to the Noteful client and accepts CRUD http requests.

## Scripts

Start the application `npm start`

Start nodemon for the application `npm run dev`

Run the tests `npm test`
